      desc: `"Hey there Tena. I just wanted to follow up with some positive news after our session. I do biofeedback weekly. It's something I have been doing for 7 months. It's something that helps to trigger your parasympathetic system to help your body be in a state of healing. Well today that cleared to 71% where as before it would be as low as 3%.. and for the first time in 7 months that I've been doing it, my lymph system did not pop up at all when it has been chronic this whole time! And it's only been 4 days since the session! 

      I couldn't believe it. 
            
      What an amazing way to physically validate the healing. I feel very grateful and happy. 
      
      I'm so passionate about helpingther people on their journey like you have done for me. I hope we can explore that together and find out what that might look like as I get further in my journey. I've also had several very powerful and insightful dreams since my session. You're a beautiful soul and I feel blessed to have found you in my journey." - Jolene `,

      desc: `"My name is Demi. I wanted to do BQH because for the past 32 years I have been in extreme trauma. There was certain things that I wanted to clear blockages on, and I felt led to do BQH. Let me tell you guys, I am so glad I did it! Since my BQH I have experienced feeling light. I have several opportunities that have come my way that I waited 5 years for. I don't have a desire to eat cheeseburgers and fried food. I crave light fresh foods now. I have no clue how this has happened because I actually loved a good cheeseburger. I also wake up on my own at 4am everyday to work out. I used to also be a heavy smoker but now smoking is too strong for my body. I can't imagine going back to smoking now. I have no clue how this happened for me but I am completely appreciative for it. Thank you so much Tena this experience has literally changed my life for the BEST!!`,

      desc: `"Tena Dodds  gave me a remote session recently and it was so amazing. She led me through a life where everyone on my planet, which was actually one of Jupiter's moons, stood facing Gaia and sent healing, loving energy to help the people and the planet to heal. It was a service we performed when needed, to other planets as well. She guided me through the releasing of two attachments and called ArchAngel Michael down to escort them home. It was so cool to see him from the client side. He came so quickly, and looked like the blue in the center of a flame. He put his arm around my shoulder and hugged me. It was the most comforting, heart-opening experience ever. I'm welling up just thinking of it. Tena's sweet, soft and gentle voice never wavered even though I had a very cranky attachment talking to her. I'm so glad that she helped me get rid of that negative energy and leave me with a cleaner, higher vibration. I am genuinely happy to recommend her for hypnosis. She is patient and calm. She keeps control of the session and moves it forward. If you are thinking of connecting with her for some healing, loving light and answers to some deep questions, follow your intuition and make an appointment. She is a natural healer!"- Terrell, BQH, IH, QHHT practitioner

      desc: `"Tena is a gifted, knowledgeable healer and a caring person who truly takes the time to understand her clients story. She worked with me for several days prior to my session with phone calls and videos to help me prepare. The space she created was warm and loving, both physically and energetically, I felt an immense healing begin to happen almost immediately after entering her office. Tena is a master of guided meditation and I was able to enter a deeply peaceful state to access my higher self. We can never have expectations as to what will happen in a session however mine lasted 4 hours, Tena made sure to ask all of the questions that I had prepared. I received some helpful insights and powerful healing / rest which was what my higher self deemed most important. Tena truly cares about her clients, she spent time with me after the session and gave me some helpful recommendations for practices and techniques that would be useful to me as an empath. If you are considering a regression session I highly recommend Tena as a practitioner. I am thankful to have met her and I hope to work with her again in the future. Love and blessings to you all." - Jen R.

      desc: `"I have been following Tena and her work for some time and when she offered the bubble sessions I instantly felt this was meant for me. The session I received was amazing as it truly resonated and exactly what I needed to hear. All that was said spoke to me and brought understanding about myself on a deeper level. These short sessions are a gift for those that want to understand more about themselves and connect with their higher self. It's a beautiful introduction to the in depth work that happens in the BQHH sessions. I am very grateful to have received such a powerful and activating transmission that was done from the heart. It was done with so much care and love that I have felt it while I was listening to the session. I highly recommend working with Tena if you are looking for answers that come straight from the soul. This will be a gift that you give to yourself!" -DG

      desc: `"I've been involved with healing for several years, doing my own inner child and shadow work searching for the pieces to my puzzle and the love that I always felt was missing. In my first BQH Session with Tena, I had an emotional reunion with my Sirian parents. I knew that I was a Starseed but in being reunited with my star family, I was able to feel the pure overwhelming unconditional love that was missing in my life. I brought it back with me and for the first time in my life I realized it was always a part of me and no longer was I searching for something that I could never find on Earth. I am the love I was searching for!! That alone was worth it. I also met my galactic guide and light council who were quite amusing and animated and answered all of my lifelong questions and more. Tena was able to hold a loving safe space for me to be open and vulnerable. She instilled a deep level of trust and security while I dove headfirst into my most personal issues. Her overall presence is so comforting and there's something about her voice that helps me go deeper and is extremely soothing. 

      During the interview, I found it very helpful that she emphasized the idea of trust. Trust in myself and the impressions that presented before me. When my ego started questioning everything I was able to quickly remember her voice telling me to trust what I saw..and I did. Since then we have had two more sessions together and I was able to explore aspects of myself I never thought possible! Each aspect helped me further place the puzzle pieces and understand why and how things had to be as they are. Each session has been more profound and magical than the first! Besides reconnecting with my star family, guides and light council, I've connected with angels and ArchAngels, God, my Ego, my childhood imaginary friend, Joe Mikey while exploring my childhood home, I've seen myself as a squirrel in current time, explored a spaceship and had every question I've ever had about my soul's existence answered. With her expert guidance and loving nature, I've been able to heal on a level I never thought possible. Through these BQH sessions with Tena everything makes sense now and I have a profound understanding of who I am. I would highly recommend Tena because of her passion for this work. My life has changed in extraordinary ways because I was able to discover myself and heal far beyond what I could've done with any other modality. Tenaâ€™s competence as a practitioner in knowing how to steer the ship for each unique session gave us both the opportunity to experience profound synchronicities and revelations that were completely relevant and magical in every way. Since then, she has asked me to be a surrogate for those who need a lended voice and I've agreed. I was able to witness this work for personal and non-personal reasons and still found that the non-personal sessions brought so much beauty, color, and perspective into my life. Tena is able to facilitate professionally while also adding a personal touch and I feel that type of spin is necessary to have a successful journey to one's soul."- K.B.`,

      desc: `Wow! Tena and Karen are the real deal! My partner and I received an RSR - Remote Spirit Release - and I felt the shift almost immediately! This dynamic duo worked their magic in helping to remove "infringements", "earth-bounds" and so many other entities that had found a "cozy home" (albeit, not invited) on Us and our Home. With Tena's meticulous expertise and support as a Facilitator (surrogate), and Karen's immense depth to fearlessly access the other realms, I immediately felt safe and cared for and knew I was in good hands. They didn't cut corners and took the time and conscious care needed to completely remove any and ALL attachments that were lingering.
      Tena was very prompt and responsive in our email communication prior to the session, and thoughtfully and warmly, answered all of the MANY questions and concerns I had.
      I highly recommend their service to anyone who is feeling, on a regular basis, unmotivated, depressed, disenfranchised, lack of focus, irritable, apathetic, etc. - especially the Remote Spirit Release (RSR) - Health Check offering. I knew I would benefit from this, but, I was truly surprised at how many attachments I had since birth, slowly and methodically gnawing and chipping away at my soul and Life Force Energy! Immensely Powerful Experience! Gift Yourself this service, they will not disappoint!`,

      desc: `Hi Tena and Karen and Zen,

      Thank you very much for the clearing. 
      
      I would say it was very accurate. I didn't know about the entities or portals specifically but suspected blockages of some sort in the upper chakras. With the sub-personalities there was a significant trauma at 15 and there were some difficulties occurring between 10 and 12, so that was spot on. I work with kids so maybe that was why the two kids (earthbound souls) felt safe around me. The self-created thoughts was spot on. I've known for a long time I need to stand in my power and be assertive and confident within myself and it's a challenge. I will remember to be kinder to myself :) Hoping the BQH can also assist with that.- Maureen `,

      desc: `Overall it was a magnificent experience to have had with Tena and Karen starting with how pleasantly kind and communicative Tena was over our emails. She provided me with the after session information and care so that I would know what they were going to work on before the actual spirit releasement session later that evening. 

      Before I knew it, I received the recording of the session to listen to it and was pleasantly surprised by how simple and straightforward it was from beginning to end. Tena coordinated very well with Karen and the spirit guide (Zen) for each section including checking my sovereignty and grounding level, negative soul contracts (none thankfully), removing negative entities (2 present), a couple earthbound spirits, several portals and parasites, clearing my etheric body and chakras. They worked on clearing my negative thoughtforms, removing a few implants, lifting my ancestral curse and black magic which I was surprised to learn that I had. There were even roadblocks and other obstacles put in my way that they helped to clear which explains why I've had a challenging awakening path till now. 
      
      My favorite part of the session was the disassociated sub-personalities where Zen and Karen accurately identified different parts of myself from my inner child till my present age. They helped to clear the trauma that caused them to disassociate with me and helped my sub-personalities to heal and reintegrate back into my body. As a result I feel lighter, more whole and more positive about myself. The various insights I gained from Zen through Karen speaking about what caused all of these issues and how to prevent them was very much what I needed to know. Tena handled the information very well and I can say that my life is definitely going to get better now thanks to all of their help. 
      
      I highly recommend them to others to try and see for yourself that these multidimensional influences do have a significant effect on one's life. They're an amazing team and I feel more empowered than ever to be the beacon to light I came here to be and affect others in my own way. Thanks ever so much again Tena and Karen for your help and support and all the best for your future spirit releasement sessions! ðŸ¥°
      
      Eternal love and gratitude, JJ`,
