            Beyond Quantum Healing (BQH) is on the cutting-edge of healing and
            transformation. It is a highly advanced and effective heart and
            energy based modality that allows for deep healing on all levels.
            The power, beauty, and magic of BQH never cease to astound me! And
            the best part is that it can be done in-person or online so you can
            experience the magic through our connection from anywhere in the
            world! With BQH, you are gently guided into a relaxed and focused
            state of awareness just like following a guided meditation. In this
            state, we will bypass the conscious, thinking mind and tap into the
            wisdom and knowing of your subconscious. When you allow your mind to
            go quiet, you will go deeper and be more OPEN than ever before so
            you can hear the wisdom of your Higher Self, the part of you that is
            connected to All That IS. This part of us goes by many names. Some
            people call it the God-mind, the Soul, the Higher Self, the
            Subconscious. Regardless of what we call it, you will be accessing a
            part of you that holds all the knowledge and secrets to this life
            and any and all lifetimes you may have experienced before.
            Connecting into this deepest part of you and creatively exploring
            other lifetimes or aspects of yourself allows you to experience what
            you need for deep transformative healing and uncovers a treasure
            trove of limitless potential. In simple terms, it's exploring the
            'past' in order to heal the present. Sometimes just by recognizing
            or validating what has happened in the past, current life issues are
            understood and healed instantaneously. This is the power of Quantum
            Healing; healing on the highest, yet deepest level across all realms
            of multi-dimensional reality. Keeping in mind that many factors play
            into why certain things occur in our lives, the potential for a
            miracle is never promised but also very real, possible and worth a
            chance.

            WHY QUANTUM HEALING?

            <p className="text-xs sm:text-sm md:text-base">
              We come into this life carrying cellular memories from past lives
              that may include trauma, unhealthy patterns, and limiting beliefs
              that are subconsciously affecting us. All we've ever been through
              and experienced is stored within our DNA. In order to experience
              these details, Quantum Healing takes us deep within the vast space
              of our inner reality where we find all the answers that we need.
              We go to the Quantum level and beyond where we can heal and clear
              the cellular memory as well as any physical issues you may be
              experiencing if your Inner Wisdom deems appropriate. When your
              body is in relaxed and focused state of being, it allows for
              healing at the cellular level.
