                I share my story hoping that it may help you and maybe you'll
                relate in some way. What I know for sure is that there is an
                innate intelligence that lies within each of us that allows for
                healing. All healing is self-healing. On some level, we create
                our illness or dis-ease and we can heal from it. ​ I've been my
                own guinea pig in testing this hypothesis. I've been diagnosed
                with anxiety, depression, PTSD, Lyme disease, lupus,
                fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease, connective tissue
                disease, stage 4 endometriosis and the list goes on. Just
                labels. I was in pain on all levels and after the traditional
                medical community not only failed to help or give me any sound
                advice, but made me worse with drug after drug after drug, I
                turned within and started healing myself...the only other place
                left to go. At every turn, I was pointed back inward. ​ With
                assistance from Higher Self, my angels, star family, and guides
                I've been able to heal my mind, body and soul, transcending
                those labels and gaining an enormous amount of wisdom in the
                process. Wisdom is only healed pain. It's enduring and
                transcending insurmountable challenges and taking with you all
                that you've learned on the journey in order to share with
                others. ​ Although I'm still healing, I hope to share with you
                what I've learned so that you don't have to suffer like I did
                for so long. From my own Beyond Quantum Healing session, I
                learned that I'm a guide for a group of souls on the spirit side
                who took their own lives... as I almost did many times.
                Sometimes the pain we experience as humans is just too great for
                some to bear. But I'm here to offer you hope, it can get better,
                you can heal! From all of it! ​ The beauty of it is that healing
                is available for all of us! It is within YOU and I'd love more
                than anything to help you tap into your own power as the Divine
                Creator that you are. The secrets to your healing lie within you
                and we can facilitate your healing by helping you tap into that
                treasure trove of possibilities. Please feel free to email or
                message me for more information, to book a BQH session, or just
                to chat. You can also watch videos on our YouTube channel, click
                on the videos tabs or the YouTube link. I'd love to connect with
                you soon!

              <p>
                If you were to ask me ANYTIME before 2020 if I was going to slay
                demons or go into the darker dimension to hunt down the "bad
                guys"... I'd laugh at you and say you're crazy. Growing up
                Catholic, my grandmother talked often of hell and instilled so
                much fear around those topics. I stayed where I felt safe and
                that was always far far away from scary movies and the occult.
                If you knew the key to my heart, you'd bring me to Blockbuster
                and buy me a romcom. I had to be so in love with a person to
                watch anything scary with them... and it's telling that the
                first time I met Tena, we watched The Conjuring... and little
                did we know that we were paving the way on a romantic endeavor
                into the dark realms of people's hell! We joked and called
                ourselves The Warrens... and that's literally been the big clue
                from our first "romantic" scary movie together. ​ I had to do a
                lot of healing of my own traumas and fortunate enough had a
                partner in Tena to mirror my own darkness. I never would have
                called myself a medium, but perhaps a professional daydreamer.
                It's a blessing that Tena and I had gone down the path, a very
                parallel one to say the least, as it has given us 8 years of
                continuing education in understanding the matrix and how to
                combat the darkness with our own Divine Source Light within. ​
                If I can offer any assistance in other people's journey, my goal
                is to give them hope. I have combatted my own mental "illness"
                and have thrived through committing to my trauma healing that
                included removing an army of entities that had attached to me in
                my teens. I have done so much trauma work on myself, seeing all
                the hard things that had kept me limited and small and have
                courageously created a life that is in alignment to serving
                others in the name of Freedom. ​ With the hundreds of clients
                that we have had in a short period, I would say 98% have found
                peace after they have worked with us. It gives us the drive we
                need to help aid our world back into true organic light. It is
                our mission and purpose to uncover the hidden unconventional
                truth of this matrix... and to be a guide to those that are
                ready to partake in their most authentic journey. We look
                forward to working with you! ​
